                No. Crowdsource is a community effort–we rely on the goodwill of community members to help improve the quality of services such as Google Maps, Google Translate, and others, so that everybody in the world can benefit.

                The mobile app is just one of the ways that you can help answer questions for Crowdsource. The answers that you give reside on our servers, and therefore are not automatically removed when you uninstall the app.

              <p>
                Yes. The app will store a few tasks every time you’re connected to WiFi or cellular (depending on what you've selected in Crowdsource Settings). You can therefore do tasks even when you don’t have a connection. Your answers and contribution count are synced whenever you get back online.

                Yes, Crowdsource will occasionally send friendly notifications to encourage you to complete tasks and meet your task pledges. As for emails, Crowdsource will send local event announcements to all contributors, and quarterly newsletters to contributors that have reached Level 5 or higher.

                A crowdsource learning community is an online platform where people come together to share their knowledge and learn from each other. This can be done through a variety of activities, such as: <br>
                - Asking and answering questions: Members can ask questions about any topic they are interested in, and other members can provide answers and insights. <br>
                - Sharing resources: Members can share articles, videos, podcasts, and other resources that they find helpful. <br>
                - Participating in discussions: Members can discuss topics of interest with other members, and learn from each other's perspectives.
